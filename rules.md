# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will study programming for at 2 hours every day for the next 100 days, and then all day on the weekends.*
### *There are two main topics that I want to study: C++ and LLVM. I will alternate the days for studying these two topics. Each topic has a separate counter for it's own 100 days.*

#### Start Date
Feb 1, 2021

## Additional Rules
1. These 2 hours should be productive time, not wasted.
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress so that others can see my progress.
4. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
